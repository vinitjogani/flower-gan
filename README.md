# flower-gan
This is a simple GAN model in Keras. One important trick that I learned was to add some noise to the labels when training the discriminator to give an opportunity for the generator to remain competetive.

Results weren't perfect, but they kinda look like flowers if you squinch your eyes hard enough.
